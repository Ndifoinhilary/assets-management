Here are real-life examples of how each order type works:

## MARKET Order
**Scenario**: You want to buy Apple stock immediately at whatever the current price is.
- Current Apple price: $150.25
- You place a MARKET order to buy 100 shares
- **Result**: Order executes instantly at ~$150.25, total cost ~$15,025

## LIMIT Order
**Scenario**: You think Tesla is overpriced at $200 but would buy if it drops to $180.
- Current Tesla price: $200
- You place a LIMIT order to buy 50 shares at $180
- **Result**: Order sits waiting. Only executes if Tesla drops to $180 or below

## STOP Order (Stop-Loss)
**Scenario**: You own Microsoft at $300/share but want to limit losses if it falls.
- Current Microsoft price: $300
- You place a STOP order to sell 100 shares at $280 (stop price)
- **Result**: If Microsoft drops to $280, it triggers a MARKET sell order to minimize your losses

## STOP_LIMIT Order
**Scenario**: You own Amazon at $120 but want controlled selling if it drops.
- Current Amazon price: $120
- You place a STOP_LIMIT order: stop price $110, limit price $108
- **Result**: If Amazon hits $110, it triggers a LIMIT sell order at $108. Won't sell below $108, protecting you from flash crashes

These order types give traders control over timing, price, and risk management in their trading strategies.
